TinyMount is a little GUI tool for mount/umount devices, using UDisks.

Main features are:

 - Tray icon with menu to see currently connected devices.
 - Notifications about connected/disconnected divices.
 - Mounting/unmounting by one click.

TinyMount is inspired by internal KDE mounter, but has no dependencies on
KDE libs (but it Qt based, sorry) and can be used with lightweight 
windowmanagers like awesome, *boxes etc with internal tray support, or
with separate tray applications (like stalonetray) if your manager doesn't
support tray.
